# Santorini

One of the mentors who pushed me to learn to code suggested simulating one of our favourite 2-player abstract board games as a useful exercise in learning OOP and functional programming. It provided a brilliant platform for validating the OOP and functional programming concepts we were learning on the course as I went along and my skills improved.

## Getting Started

Clone down the repo to your local machine, open with a live server extension.

### Prerequisites

A source Code Editor or IDE, a live Sass compiler extension (e.g. Live Sass Compiler), Sass.

### Installing

Run yarn install in command line (or use your package manager) to install dependencies.

## Deployment

Deployed via github pages.

## Built With

* [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5) - Templating
* [JavaScript ES6](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_es6.asp) - Functionality
* [CSS3](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Archive/CSS3) - Styling
* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - Styling

## Versioning

Version control with [Git](https://git-scm.com/).  

## Next steps

* Need to code in response for move legality for edge case scenario where no pieces remain of a certain level so certain moves are prohibited.
* Refactor code now I am a better developer. Much was written as I was learning, so reflects the skill set I had available at that time.
* Code in ability to play across the web.
* Code in ability to save, and revert to previous game states so that moves can be 'undone' and people can save games over time and return to them later
